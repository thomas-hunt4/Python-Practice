Day 34-35: Performance Optimization and Best Practices
Concepts:

Time complexity analysis
Memory usage optimization
Choosing right data structures
Common pitfalls and solutions
Examples:

python
# Performance comparison examples
import time

# List vs Set for membership testing
large_list = list(range(10000))
large_set = set(range(10000))

# Test membership (set is O(1), list is O(n))
start = time.time()
9999 in large_list
list_time = time.time() - start

start = time.time()
9999 in large_set
set_time = time.time() - start

# Dictionary get() vs try/except
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Good practice
value = data.get('d', 0)

# vs checking existence first
if 'd' in data:
    value = data['d']
else:
    value = 0
